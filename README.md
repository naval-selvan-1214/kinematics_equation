# Model of Gyrosphere
The Sphere model consists of an **Internal driving unit (IDU)** enclosed by two hemispherical shells joined together. The IDU is a tetrahedral skeleton made by joining four cylindrical rods connecting them tetrahedrally. End of the rods are attached with **omni wheels** which are in contact with the internal surface of the spherical unit except the top rod which has a **ball and socket joint** for maintaining the upright position of the IDU. Omniwheels used are controlled by **BLDC motors**. The central mass is attached below the driving unit.
