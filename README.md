# Model of Gyrosphere
Spherical model of our bot consists an **internal driving unit (IDU)** in contact with two hemispherical shells joined together.
The IDU is made by joining 4 cylindrical rods tetrahedrally at the centre. Rods have **omni wheels** at their end touching the internal surface of the sphere as shown in the figure below except the top one which has a **ball and socket joint** at its end for maintaining the upright position of IDU during the movement of the bot. 
Servo motors are used to control the movement of omni wheels.

# Kinematics of Gyrosphere
Let the rotation of the sphere about the Z axis be ɸ.<br>
Let the rotation of the sphere with respect to its centre about X axis be θ.<br>
So Rotation matrices for the sphere about Z and X axes are
