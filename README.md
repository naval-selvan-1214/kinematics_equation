# Model of Gyrosphere
Spherical model of our bot consists an **internal driving unit (IDU)** in contact with two hemispherical shells joined together.
The IDU is made by joining 4 cylindrical rods tetrahedrally at the centre. Rods have **omni wheels** at their end touching the internal surface of the sphere as shown in the figure below except the top one which has a **ball and socket joint** at its end for maintaining the upright position of IDU during the movement of the bot. 
Servo motors are used to control the movement of omni wheels.
